    I have implemented core systems and mechanics, support for multiple languages, integrated ads and 
    in-app purchases, integrated and edited assets provided by the client, and tested and delivered builds 
    periodically.

- title: Educational Project
  project_description: >
    A collection of immersive applications that teach the user how to handle various situations 
    in their specific work fields.
  description: >
    I have taken the initiative to refactor and expand the codebase 
    that was shared across multiple projects, and so I became the systems engineer of the 
    team. My contributions consisted of systems that handle Score, Objectives, Requirements, 
    Dialog, Quiz, and TTS accessibility, which was the most complex one. I have optimized the way 
    the TTS system handles large amount of audio files that are downloaded during a session, by 
    dynamically determining which ones have the highest priority based on the player’s progression 
    in the current level.
